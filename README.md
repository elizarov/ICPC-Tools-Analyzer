# ICPC Tools Analyzer

To run open project in IDEA, oepn [Analyze.kt](src/Analyze.kt) and run its `main` function.
It needs two parameters:
* `<event-feed-json>` &mdash; JSON file with event feed.
* `<ps-files-dir>` &mdash; Directory with `ps.<team>.txt` files.

It writes a number of output files to the current directory with analysis.
